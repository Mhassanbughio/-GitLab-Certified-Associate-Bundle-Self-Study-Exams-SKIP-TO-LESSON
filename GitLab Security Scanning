Security scanner integration
Integrating a security scanner into GitLab consists of providing end users with a CI job definition they can add to their CI configuration files to scan their GitLab projects. This CI job should then output its results in a GitLab-specified format.
These results are then automatically presented in various places in GitLab, such as the Pipeline view, Merge Request widget, and Security Dashboard.
