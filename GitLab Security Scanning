GitLab provides several built in security scanners, these can be easily added to your .
gitlab-ci.yml files by using the includes -template feature. Read more about the various options below!


Security scanner integration
Integrating a security scanner into GitLab consists of providing end users with a CI job definition they can add to their CI configuration files to scan their GitLab projects. 
This CI job should then output its results in a GitLab-specified format.
These results are then automatically presented in various places in GitLab, such as the Pipeline view, Merge Request widget, and Security Dashboard.

The scanning job is usually based on a Docker image that contains the scanner and all its dependencies in a self-contained environment.

This page documents requirements and guidelines for writing CI jobs that implement a security scanner, as well as requirements and guidelines for the Docker image.
