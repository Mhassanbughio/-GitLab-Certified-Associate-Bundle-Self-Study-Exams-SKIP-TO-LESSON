#####################################################LAB 2: WORKING WITH GIT LOCALLY ############################################################################
Verify git is installed locally
Open a terminal session or command prompt and type git version. If it prints a version number, git is installed.


Generate an SSH key

These steps are only needed if you do not have an SSH key already installed.
In a terminal or command prompt, type ssh-keygen
If prompted for a key type, choose ed25519, which is more secure than the more older id_rsa type.
You will be prompted to select the location in which your key will be saved. Press Enter to leave it at the default.
You may be prompted to create a passphrase. Leave it blank or enter a passphrase of your choice, and then hit Enter. 
If you do use a passphrase, you'll have to enter it every time you push or pull code from GitLab.com.

 ##################  2nd Step ###########################################

Add an SSH Key to Your GitLab profile
In the top right-hand corner of the the GitLab app, locate your user avatar and click the down arrow.
