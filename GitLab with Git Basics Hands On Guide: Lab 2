#####################################################LAB 2: WORKING WITH GIT LOCALLY ############################################################################
Verify git is installed locally
Open a terminal session or command prompt and type git version. If it prints a version number, git is installed.


Generate an SSH key

These steps are only needed if you do not have an SSH key already installed.
In a terminal or command prompt, type ssh-keygen
If prompted for a key type, choose ed25519, which is more secure than the more older id_rsa type.
You will be prompted to select the location in which your key will be saved. Press Enter to leave it at the default.
You may be prompted to create a passphrase. Leave it blank or enter a passphrase of your choice, and then hit Enter. 
If you do use a passphrase, you'll have to enter it every time you push or pull code from GitLab.com.

 ##################  2nd Step ###########################################

Add an SSH Key to Your GitLab profile

In the top right-hand corner of the the GitLab app, locate your user avatar and click the down arrow.
From the dropdown menu, click the Edit profile item.
On the left-hand side of the screen, click on SSH Keys.
If you have no SSH keys added to your profile, you will land on the Add an SSH Key screen.
Return to your terminal/command session. To retrieve the SSH key you created, move into the folder you saved it to by typing cd {file path}
Type ls -al to see two key files: a public key and a private key. The public key is called either id_ed25519.pub or id_rsa.pub and is what you need to share with GitLab.
Type cat id_ed25519.pub or cat id_rsa.pub (depending on which kind of key you generated) to print the contents of your public key. Copy those contents to your clipboard.
Return to the GitLab app in your browser. Paste the public key contents into the Key field, enter any title you want in the Title field, and click Add key.
Your local computer is now authenticated to push and pull (interact) with GitLab.

Copy (clone) a project repo to your local machine

Use the top navigation bar to get back to your Project Overview by clicking Projects > Your projects.
Find your Top Level Project by looking for the one with the Owner label next to it (you might need to advance to the next page of projects).
Locate the blue Clone button and click the dropdown arrow.
In the Clone with SSH section, click the Copy URL button.

In your terminal/command window, type cd to get out of the .ssh directory and into your home directory.
Type mkdir training to create a new directory.
Type cd training to move into your new directory.
Type git clone <URL you copied previously> to copy the git repository from your Top Level Project onto your local machine.
