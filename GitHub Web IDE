The Web IDE editor makes it faster and easier to contribute changes to your projects by providing an advanced editor with commit staging.

File finder
Introduced in GitLab Free 10.8.

The file finder allows you to quickly open files in the current branch by searching for fragments of the file path. 
The file finder is launched using the keyboard shortcut Command+p, Control+p, or t (when editor is not in focus).
Type the filename or file path fragments to start seeing results.

Command palette
You can see all available commands for manipulating editor content by pressing the F1 key when the editor is in focus. 
After that, the editor displays a complete list of available commands for manipulating editor content. 
The editor supports commands for multi-cursor editing, code block folding, commenting, searching and replacing, 
navigating editor warnings and suggestions, and more.

Some commands have a keyboard shortcut assigned to them. The command palette displays this shortcut next to each command.
You can use this shortcut to invoke the command without having to select it in the command palette.

Syntax highlighting

As expected from an IDE, syntax highlighting for many languages in the Web IDE makes your direct editing even easier.

The Web IDE currently provides:

Basic syntax colorization for a variety of programming, scripting and markup languages such as XML, PHP, C#, C++, Markdown, Java, VB, Batch, Python, Ruby, and Objective-C.
IntelliSense and validation support (displaying errors and warnings, providing smart completions, formatting, and outlining) for some languages. 
For example: TypeScript, JavaScript, CSS, LESS, SCSS, JSON, and HTML.
Because the Web IDE is based on the Monaco Editor, you can find a more complete list of supported languages in the Monaco languages repository. 
Under the hood, Monaco uses the Monarch library for syntax highlighting.

If you are missing Syntax Highlighting support for any language, we prepared a short guide on how to add support for a missing language Syntax Highligh
Highlight lines
WebIDE is built with the Web Editor. This enables WebIDE to share the same core features for highlighting and linking to particular lines in the edited files described for the Web Editor.

Schema based validation

Version history
The Web IDE provides validation support for certain JSON and YAML files using schemas based on the JSON Schema Store.

Predefined schemas
The Web IDE has validation for certain files built in. This feature is only supported for the *.gitlab-ci.yml files.

Enable or disable validation based on predefined schemas ALL TIERSSELF-MANAGED
Validation based on predefined schemas is under development and not ready for production use.
It is deployed behind a feature flag that is disabled by default for self-managed instances,
GitLab administrators with access to the GitLab Rails console can enable it for your instance.

To enable it:
Feature.enable(:schema_linting)
Feature.disable(:schema_linting)
