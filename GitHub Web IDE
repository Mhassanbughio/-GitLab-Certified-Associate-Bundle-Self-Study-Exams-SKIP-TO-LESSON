The Web IDE editor makes it faster and easier to contribute changes to your projects by providing an advanced editor with commit staging.

File finder
Introduced in GitLab Free 10.8.

The file finder allows you to quickly open files in the current branch by searching for fragments of the file path. 
The file finder is launched using the keyboard shortcut Command+p, Control+p, or t (when editor is not in focus).
Type the filename or file path fragments to start seeing results.

Command palette
You can see all available commands for manipulating editor content by pressing the F1 key when the editor is in focus. 
After that, the editor displays a complete list of available commands for manipulating editor content. 
The editor supports commands for multi-cursor editing, code block folding, commenting, searching and replacing, 
navigating editor warnings and suggestions, and more.

Some commands have a keyboard shortcut assigned to them. The command palette displays this shortcut next to each command.
You can use this shortcut to invoke the command without having to select it in the command palette.
