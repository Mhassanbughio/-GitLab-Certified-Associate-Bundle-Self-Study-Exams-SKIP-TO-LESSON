GitLab with Git Basics Hands On Guide: Lab 6

LAB 6: Static Application Security Testing (SAST)
SAST, an optional feature of CI/CD pipelines, analyzes your source code for known vulnerabilities. On every commit to a SAST-enabled project, 

GitLab checks the SAST report and compares the found vulnerabilities between the source and target branches.

The purpose of this lab is to use SAST to identify potential security vulnerabilities in your code.
