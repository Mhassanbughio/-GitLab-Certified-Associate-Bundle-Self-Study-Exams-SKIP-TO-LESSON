Wiki
If you don’t want to keep your documentation in your repository, but you do want to keep it in the same project as your code, you can use the wiki GitLab provides in each GitLab project. Every wiki is a separate Git repository, so you can create wiki pages in the web interface, or locally using Git.

To access the wiki for a project or group, go to the page for your project or group and, in the left sidebar, select Wiki. If Wiki is not listed in the left sidebar, a project administrator has disabled it.

GitLab wikis support Markdown, RDoc, AsciiDoc, and Org for content. Wiki pages written in Markdown support all Markdown features, and also provide some wiki-specific behavior for links.

In GitLab 13.5 and later, wiki pages display a sidebar, which you can customize. This sidebar contains a partial list of pages in the wiki, displayed as a nested tree, with sibling pages listed in alphabetical order. To view a list of all pages, select View All Pages in the sidebar:

Create the wiki home page
When a wiki is created, it is empty. On your first visit, create the landing page users see when viewing the wiki:

Go to the page for your project or group.
In the left sidebar, select Wiki, then Create your first page.
Select a Format for styling your text.
Add a welcome message in the Content section. You can always edit it later.
Add a Commit message. Git requires a commit message, so GitLab creates one if you don’t enter one yourself.
Select Create page.
Create a new wiki page


Create a new wiki page
Users with Developer permissions can create new wiki pages:

Go to the page for your project or group.
In the left sidebar, select Wiki.
Select New page on this page, or any other wiki page.
Select a content format.
Add a title for your new page. Page titles use special characters for subdirectories and formatting, and have length restrictions.
Add content to your wiki page.
(Optional) Attach a file, and GitLab stores it according to your installed version of GitLab:
Files added in GitLab 11.3 and later: Files are stored in the wiki’s Git repository.
Files added GitLab 11.2 and earlier: Files are stored in GitLab itself. To add the file to the wiki’s Git repository, you must re-upload the file.
Add a Commit message. Git requires a commit message, so GitLab creates one if you don’t enter one yourself.
Select Create page.
Create or edit wiki pages locally

Wikis are based on Git repositories, so you can clone them locally and edit them like you would do with every other Git repository. To clone a wiki repository locally, select Clone repository from the right-hand sidebar of any wiki page, and follow the on-screen instructions.

Files you add to your wiki locally must use one of the following supported extensions, depending on the markup language you wish to use. Files with unsupported extensions don’t display when pushed to GitLab:

Markdown extensions: .mdown, .mkd, .mkdn, .md, .markdown.
AsciiDoc extensions: .adoc, .ad, .asciidoc.
Other markup extensions: .textile, .rdoc, .org, .creole, .wiki, .mediawiki, .rst.
Special characters in page titles

Wiki pages are stored as files in a Git repository, so certain characters have a special meaning:

Spaces are converted into hyphens when storing a page.
Hyphens (-) are converted back into spaces when displaying a page.
Slashes (/) are used as path separators, and can’t be displayed in titles. If you create a title containing / characters, GitLab creates all the subdirectories needed to build that path. For example, a title of docs/my-page creates a wiki page with a path /wikis/docs/my-page.
Length restrictions for file and directory names
