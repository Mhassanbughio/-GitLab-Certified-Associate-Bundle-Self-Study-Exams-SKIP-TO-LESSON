Package Stage Functions 1

Package Registry

Every team needs a place to store their packages and dependencies. GitLab aims to provide a comprehensive solution, 
integrated into our single application, that supports package management for all commonly used languages and binary formats.

Container Registry
A container registry* is a secure and private registry for Docker images built-in to GitLab.
Creating, pushing, and retrieving images works out of the box with GitLab CI/CD.
*Available for Premium and Ultimate

Helm Chart Registry

Kubernetes cluster integrations can take advantage of Helm charts to standardize their distribution and install processes. 
Supporting a built-in helm chart registry allows for better, self-managed container orchestration.

Dependency Proxy
The GitLab dependency proxy* can serve as an intermediary between your local developers and automation and 
the world of packages that need to be fetched from remote repositories. By adding a security and validation layer to a caching proxy,
you can ensure reliability, accuracy, and audit-ability for the packages you depend on.
