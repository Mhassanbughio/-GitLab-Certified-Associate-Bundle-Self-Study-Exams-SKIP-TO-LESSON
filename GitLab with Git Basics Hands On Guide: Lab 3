Create a merge request

Just above the comment box, click the dropdown arrow next to the green Create merge request button. 
The dropdown lets you customize the branch name for this new merge request. For this exercise, leave it at the default.
Click Create merge request to make a merge request for a branch named after the issue's title.

Edit files on a branch, using GitLab's Web IDE

In the middle of the merge request page, click Open in Web IDE.
Double-check that you are on the branch you just created by looking for the branch name in a dropdown in the top left corner of the page.
In the left-hand file list, click README.md.
On line 3 of the file, type Edit my README.md file.
Click the blue Commit… button at the bottom of the screen.
In the commit message box, type Updated the README.md file. Leave the radio box button at the default, so the commit will be on the branch you created earlier. Click Commit.

Verify Changes in a Merge Request

Navigate to the merge request you just added a commit to. A convenient way to do this is to click 
the small blue link at the very bottom of the page, that shows an exclamation point and the merge request number.
On the merge request page, locate the Assignee section in the upper right-hand corner 
(you might have to click the double arrow at the top right of the screen to expand the widget bar). Ensure the merge request is assigned to yourself.
Click the Changes tab directly below the merge request title.
Hover over the left side of any line, and a comment icon will appear. Hover over line 3 and click the comment icon.
In the comment field, type this code will fix this! and click the Start a review button. Click Submit review to add your comment.
To mark that the comment has been seen and the commit has been adjusted, close the review by clicking Resolve thread.

#############################################################################################################################

Approve the merge request
To mark the merge request ready to merge, click Mark as ready in the upper right-hand corner.
Click the Overview tab.
If there were eligible approvers, an Approve button would be in the View eligible approvers section.
Ensure the Delete source branch checkbox is enabled, and click the green Merge button.
Navigate back to your repository's project by clicking Repository in the left-hand nav bar. Switch to the master branch in the branch dropdown at the top left of the page, if you're not on that branch already. Verify that the merge successfully added the Edit my README.md file line to the bottom of README.md.
