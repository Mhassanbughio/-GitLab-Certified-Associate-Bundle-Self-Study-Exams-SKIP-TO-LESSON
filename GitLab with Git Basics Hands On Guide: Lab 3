####################################################################################################################################################

Create a new project and issue
Navigate to your group, click the New project button, click Create blank project, and name your project Second Project.
Under Visibility Level, click the radio button for Private.
Enable the Initialize repository with a README checkbox.
Click the green Create project button. After a few seconds it will take you to a page showing your new project's details.
On the left-hand side of the screen, click the Issues section on the taskbar.
Click the blue New issue button.
In the title field, type new issue. Optionally, enter a comment in the Description dialog box.
In the Assignees field, click the link for Assign to me.
Click the Submit issue button to create the issue.

Create a merge request

Just above the comment box, click the dropdown arrow next to the green Create merge request button. 
The dropdown lets you customize the branch name for this new merge request. For this exercise, leave it at the default.
Click Create merge request to make a merge request for a branch named after the issue's title.

Edit files on a branch, using GitLab's Web IDE

In the middle of the merge request page, click Open in Web IDE.
Double-check that you are on the branch you just created by looking for the branch name in a dropdown in the top left corner of the page.
In the left-hand file list, click README.md.
On line 3 of the file, type Edit my README.md file.
Click the blue Commitâ€¦ button at the bottom of the screen.
In the commit message box, type Updated the README.md file. Leave the radio box button at the default, so the commit will be on the branch you created earlier. Click Commit.


Verify Changes in a Merge Request

Navigate to the merge request you just added a commit to. A convenient way to do this is to click 
the small blue link at the very bottom of the page, that shows an exclamation point and the merge request number.
On the merge request page, locate the Assignee section in the upper right-hand corner 
(you might have to click the double arrow at the top right of the screen to expand the widget bar). Ensure the merge request is assigned to yourself.
Click the Changes tab directly below the merge request title.
Hover over the left side of any line, and a comment icon will appear. Hover over line 3 and click the comment icon.
In the comment field, type this code will fix this! and click the Start a review button. Click Submit review to add your comment.
To mark that the comment has been seen and the commit has been adjusted, close the review by clicking Resolve thread.
